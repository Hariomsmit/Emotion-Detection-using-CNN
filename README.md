# Emotion-Detection-using-CNN
This project is based on face emotion detection which is able to detect around 6 different emotions like Happy, Sad, Annoyed, Surprised, Scared, etc. It is developed with application of convolutional neural networks. The accuracy of the model is quite low because the training dataset was very less.
